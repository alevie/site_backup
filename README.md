I wrote this python script to archive mysql databases and web files for multiple
sites. To use it, both files must be in the same directory. Edit the
'site_backup.cfg' file with your site(s) details (example config provided) and
run the 'site_backup.py' script. The script will automatically delete files older
than the days specified in the config file.
